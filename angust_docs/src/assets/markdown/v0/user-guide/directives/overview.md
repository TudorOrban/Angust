# Directives

**Angust Directives** are custom HTML attributes that make possible the development of highly dynamic applications. The three main directives supported at the moment are: `@if`, `@for` and `@onclick`. Stay tuned for more directives being added in the future, such as `@switch`, CSS class controllers and two-way data bindings.
