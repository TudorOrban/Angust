# What is Angust?

Angust is a Rust GUI framework designed to bridge the gap between the safety and performance of Rust and the simplicity and scalability of web development. It provides an Angular-style API for developing dynamic UI applications, through reusable Components and associated HTML templates.


This [User Guide](https://tudororban.github.io/Angust/v0/user-guide/overview) aims to cover the essential features of Angust needed to build applications. For a thorough overview of the system and guidelines to contributing, see the [Contributor Guide](https://tudororban.github.io/Angust/v0/contributor-guide/overview). For a complete list of available features, see the [API Reference](https://tudororban.github.io/Angust/v0/api-reference/overview).

&nbsp;

> **Important Note**: Angust is currently in mid stages of development. As such, it still misses many useful features, contains many bugs and optimization issues, and it has an unstable API. We plan to release a production-grade initial version of the framework in the near future.
