# Routing

Routing is generally a term in web development, referring to the mechanism through which HTTP requests are mapped to the code that handles them. However, even for GUI applications, you often need to reproduce some of that navigation logic. As such, we provide out of a the box a *Router*, i.e. an object that encapsulates navigation functionality, including a routing configuration, navigation history, page caching etc.
